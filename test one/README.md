clone this and remove the files that you won't need. 
then go to the index.html and change the following things;
* on line 10 the link to fontawesome, only do this when you have pro and don't want to use the free icons
* replace the text with {you name} to you name, add in the about me and contact me at line 45 and  58
* just leave the footer as it is :) 
* change the pfp.png to your profile picture and name the picture pfp.png just to keep it easy
